					<h2>Leeds International Film Festival</h2>

				</div>
				
<p>This year the <a href="http://www.leedsfilm.com/">Leeds International Film Festival</a> celebrates its 25th Anniversary edition from 3rd – 20th November with screenings of breathtaking British cinema, outstanding world cinema, cult archive presentations, spine-tingling live music events, thought provoking documentaries, experimental cinema and a selection of special events from Paul Merton’s Silent Clowns to the sell out horror marathon Night of the Dead. </p>
<p>From its humble beginnings at Hyde Park Picture House to the Film Festival’s giant screen at Leeds Town Hall, the event has been a part of our autumn calendar for a quarter of a century, celebrating international film in our city, where the first moving image was captured by Louis Le Prince in 1888.</p>
<p>Showcasing over 300 films in 18 days the Film Festival is now the third largest Film Festival in the UK and one of the largest cultural events in the North of England. Last year over 30,000 were among the first in the world to see some of the most talked about films of the year and discover outstanding unseen gems. This year you can choose from over 300 films in the programme at venues including <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?cid=374080630212022790&q=leeds+town+hall&hl=en&sll=53.799962,-1.549734&sspn=0.006295,0.006295&ie=UTF8&ll=53.804237,-1.55405&spn=0.000013,0.000021&t=m&z=16&vpsrc=0">Leeds Town Hall</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?cid=3138863222737357621&q=Hyde+Park+Picture+House,+Brudenell+Road,+Leeds&hl=en&sll=53.81214,-1.569257&sspn=0.013176,0.032015&ie=UTF8&ll=53.829231,-1.586494&spn=0.000051,0.000086&t=m&z=14&vpsrc=0">Hyde Park Picture House</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?cid=13448325870161079941&q=Leeds+City+Varieties,+Swan+Street,+Leeds&hl=en&sll=53.798805,-1.542951&sspn=0.01318,0.032015&ie=UTF8&ll=53.815906,-1.56023&spn=0.000051,0.000086&t=m&z=14&vpsrc=0">City Varieties</a>.</p>
